\section{Shared Part}

This could be the Shared Part of the document. It is designed to be written by all members of the team.

Each member should ideally write their details in the table of contributors in the Shared Part of the document, as well as write a subsection about their opinion on the G54FSE module this year, especially your comments on the module coordinator Max Wilson.

\subsection{Comments from the first student}
This is the first subsection. Do not forget to include the best parts about the module as well as what you did not like about Max Wilson during the term.
